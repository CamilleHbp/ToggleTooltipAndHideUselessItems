# Toggle Tooltips And Hide Looted Containers

This mod is inspired by [](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1166).

There is only one main file, `Public\Game\GUI\Widgets\WorldTooltips.xaml`.

There are two sections in it, one that hides thinks that you probably don't want to see.

The other section hides things that are useless to me but that you might want if you are a loot collector and need the money/food/etc.

## How to install

You can call the Powershell script from your terminal, as long as you added your `{LSlib Folder}/Tools` to your PATH in environment variables beforehand. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho) or [here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=add+to+edit+path+windows+11).
